"""
In processing, arduino and openFrameworks n infinit loop has been created
within the framework. In processing and oF we know it as the draw() loop and in 
arduino we know it as the loop(). Well in python we don't have that by default,
so we create infinit loops using what is called WHILE LOOPS

while True:
    print "hello world"
    #Inside this loop you can write any operation that needs
    #to be repeated forever
