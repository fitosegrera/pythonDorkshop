To install a library we can either use the command "pip" or doundload the package and install 
manually

* To use pip, on your terminal type:

    pip install libraryName

* If it denies the procedure the retry with root acces:

    sudo pip install libraryName

* If you download a package you should then install it manually:

    cd myLibraryFolder

    python setup.py install

* Again if it denies the procedure the retry with root acces:

    sudo python setup.py install

* A really good library resource for python is: www.pypi.python.org
